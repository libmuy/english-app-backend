Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.00,0:00:17.00,Default,,0,0,0,,There was such a freezing cold wind and such heavy rain that we all stayed indoors.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.00,0:00:22.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I was glad of it. I never liked long walks, especially in winter.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:22.00,0:00:27.97,Default,,0,0,0,,I used to hate coming home when it was almost dark, with ice-cold fingers and toes,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.00,0:00:33.00,Default,,0,0,0,,feeling miserable because Bessie, the nursemaid, was always scolding me.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.02,0:00:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,All the time I knew I was different from my cousins, Eliza, John and Georgiana Reed.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.00,0:00:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,They were taller and stronger than me, and they were loved.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.00,0:00:49.46,Default,,0,0,0,,These three usually spent their time crying and quarrelling,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.49,0:00:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but today they were sitting quietly around their mother in the sitting room.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.00,0:01:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I wanted to join the family circle, but Mrs. Reed, my aunt, refused.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.00,0:01:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Bessie had complained about me.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.00,0:01:11.00,Default,,0,0,0,,No, I'm sorry, Jane. Until I hear from Bessie or see for myself that you are really trying to behave better,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.00,0:01:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,you cannot be treated as a good, happy child like my children.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.00,0:01:20.00,Default,,0,0,0,,What does Bessie say I have done? I asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.00,0:01:28.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Jane, it is not polite to question me in that way. If you cannot speak pleasantly, be quiet.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.00,0:01:32.55,Default,,0,0,0,,I crept out of the sitting room and into the small room next door,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.56,0:01:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,where I chose a book full of pictures from the bookcase.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.02,0:01:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I climbed onto the window seat and drew the curtains, so that I was completely hidden.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.00,0:01:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I sat there for a while.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.00,0:01:47.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes I looked out of the window at the grey November afternoon
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.84,0:01:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,and saw the rain pouring down on the leafless garden.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.00,0:01:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,But most of the time I studied the book and stared fascinated at the pictures.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.00,0:02:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Lost in the world of imagination, I forgot my sad, lonely existence for a while and was happy.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.00,0:02:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I was only afraid that my secret hiding place might be discovered.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.00,0:02:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Suddenly, the door of the room opened. John Reed rushed in.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.00,0:02:22.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Where are you, rat? he shouted. He did not see me behind the curtain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.03,0:02:29.29,Default,,0,0,0,,Eliza, Georgie, Jane isn't here. Tell Mama she's run out into the rain.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.29,0:02:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,What a bad animal she is.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.00,0:02:35.13,Default,,0,0,0,,How lucky I drew the curtain, I thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.15,0:02:39.00,Default,,0,0,0,,He would never have found me because he was not very intelligent.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:39.00,0:02:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,But Eliza guessed at once where I was.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.00,0:02:46.00,Default,,0,0,0,,She's in the window seat, John, she called from the sitting room.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.00,0:02:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So I came out immediately, as I did not want him to pull me out.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.00,0:02:53.00,Default,,0,0,0,,What do you want? I asked him.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.00,0:03:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Say, what do you want, Master Reed? he answered, sitting in an armchair.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.00,0:03:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I want you to come here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.00,0:03:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,John Reed was 14 and I was only 10. He was large and rather fat.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.00,0:03:13.00,Default,,0,0,0,,He usually ate too much at meals, which made him ill.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.00,0:03:17.60,Default,,0,0,0,,He should have been at boarding school, but his mother, who loved him very much,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.62,0:03:23.00,Default,,0,0,0,,had brought him home for a month or two because she thought his health was delicate.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.00,0:03:28.32,Default,,0,0,0,,John did not love his mother or his sisters, and he hated me.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.38,0:03:35.83,Default,,0,0,0,,He bullied and punished me, not two or three times a week, not once or twice a day, but all the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.94,0:03:39.00,Default,,0,0,0,,My whole body trembled when he came near.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.00,0:03:43.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes he hit me, sometimes he just threatened me,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.19,0:03:48.39,Default,,0,0,0,,and I lived in terrible fear of him. I had no idea how to stop him.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.00,0:03:52.19,Default,,0,0,0,,The servants did not want to offend their young master,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.22,0:03:55.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and Mrs. Reed could see no fault in her dear boy.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.31,0:04:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So I obeyed John's order and approached his armchair,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.00,0:04:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,thinking how very ugly his face was.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.00,0:04:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps he understood what I was thinking, for he hit me hard on the face.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.00,0:04:12.70,Default,,0,0,0,,That is for your rudeness to Mama just now, he said,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.72,0:04:17.84,Default,,0,0,0,,and for your wickedness in hiding, and for looking at me like that, you rat!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.64,0:04:23.09,Default,,0,0,0,,I was so used to his bullying that I never thought of hitting him back.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:23.54,0:04:27.33,Default,,0,0,0,,What were you doing behind that curtain? he asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.38,0:04:33.01,Default,,0,0,0,,I was reading, I answered. Show me the book. I gave it to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.12,0:04:36.74,Default,,0,0,0,,You have no right to take our books, he continued.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.80,0:04:40.29,Default,,0,0,0,,You have no money, and your father left you none.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.34,0:04:45.58,Default,,0,0,0,,You ought to beg in the streets, not live here in comfort with a gentleman's family.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.11,0:04:53.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, all these books are mine, and so is the whole house, or will be in a few years' time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.25,0:04:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll teach you not to borrow my books again.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.63,0:05:00.30,Default,,0,0,0,,He lifted the heavy book and threw it hard at me.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.69,0:05:04.35,Default,,0,0,0,,It hit me and I fell, cutting my head on the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.40,0:05:12.24,Default,,0,0,0,,I was in great pain, and suddenly, for the first time in my life, I forgot my fear of John Reed.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.65,0:05:18.23,Default,,0,0,0,,You wicked, cruel boy, I cried. You are a bully.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.29,0:05:20.99,Default,,0,0,0,,You are as bad as a murderer.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.61,0:05:28.75,Default,,0,0,0,,What? What, he cried? Did she say that to me? Did you hear Eliza and Georgiana?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.83,0:05:32.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll tell Mama, but first...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.00,0:05:37.14,Default,,0,0,0,,He rushed to attack me, but now he was fighting with a desperate girl.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.37,0:05:40.19,Default,,0,0,0,,I really saw him as a wicked murderer.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.46,0:05:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I felt the blood running down my face, and the pain gave me strength.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.00,0:05:48.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I fought back as hard as I could.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:48.40,0:05:51.67,Default,,0,0,0,,My resistance surprised him, and he shouted for help.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.00,0:05:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,His sisters ran for Mrs. Reed, who called her maid Miss Abbott and Bessie.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.00,0:06:00.00,Default,,0,0,0,,They pulled us apart, and I heard them say,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:00.00,0:06:03.65,Default,,0,0,0,,What a wicked girl! She attacked Master John!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.27,0:06:09.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Mrs. Reed said calmly, Take her away to the red room and lock her in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.77,0:06:14.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And so I was carried upstairs, arms waving and legs kicking.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.39,0:06:21.29,Default,,0,0,0,,As soon as we arrived in the red room, I became quiet again, and the two servants both started scolding me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.73,0:06:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Really, Miss Eyre, said Miss Abbott, how could you hit him? He's your young master.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.85,0:06:32.15,Default,,0,0,0,,How can he be my master? I'm not a servant, I cried.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.27,0:06:39.61,Default,,0,0,0,,No, Miss Eyre, you are less than a servant because you do not work, replied Miss Abbott.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.00,0:06:43.17,Default,,0,0,0,,They both looked at me as if they strongly disapproved of me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.00,0:06:47.00,Default,,0,0,0,,You should remember, Miss, said Bessie,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.00,0:06:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,that your aunt pays for your food and clothes, and you should be grateful.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.53,0:06:54.06,Default,,0,0,0,,You have no other relations or friends.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.77,0:06:59.57,Default,,0,0,0,,All my short life I had been told this, and I had no answer to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.90,0:07:03.55,Default,,0,0,0,,I stayed silent, listening to these painful reminders.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.00,0:07:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,And if you are angry and rude, Mrs. Reed may send you away, added Bessie.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.46,0:07:16.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway, said Miss Abbott, God will punish you, Jane Eyre, for your wicked heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.00,0:07:18.43,Default,,0,0,0,,Pray to God and say you're sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.17,0:07:22.47,Default,,0,0,0,,They left the room, locking the door carefully behind them.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.54,0:07:30.51,Default,,0,0,0,,The red room was a cold, silent room, hardly ever used, although it was one of the largest bedrooms in the house.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.00,0:07:39.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Nine years ago, my uncle, Mr. Reed, had died in this room, and since then, nobody had wanted to sleep in it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.00,0:07:44.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Now that I was alone, I thought bitterly of the people I lived with.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:44.82,0:07:52.31,Default,,0,0,0,,John Reed, his sisters, his mother, the servants, they all accused me, scolded me, hated me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.70,0:07:55.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Why could I never please them?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.25,0:07:58.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Eliza was selfish but was respected.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.22,0:08:03.63,Default,,0,0,0,,Georgiana had a bad temper, but she was popular with everybody because she was beautiful.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.00,0:08:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,John was rude, cruel, and violent, but nobody punished him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.00,0:08:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I tried to make no mistakes, but they called me naughty every moment of the day.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:15.52,0:08:20.25,Default,,0,0,0,,Now that I turned against John to protect myself, everybody blamed me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.00,0:08:24.71,Default,,0,0,0,,And so I spent that whole long afternoon in the red room,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.81,0:08:29.31,Default,,0,0,0,,asking myself why I had to suffer and why life was so unfair.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:29.60,0:08:33.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps I would run away or starve myself to death.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.98,0:08:36.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Gradually, it became dark outside.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:36.82,0:08:41.34,Default,,0,0,0,,The rain was still beating on the windows, and I could hear the wind in the trees.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.00,0:08:47.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Now I was no longer angry, and I began to think the Reeds might be right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.00,0:08:50.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps I was wicked.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.31,0:08:54.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Did I deserve to die and be buried in the churchyard like my Uncle Reed?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.00,0:08:58.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I could not remember him, but knew he was my mother's brother,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.59,0:09:02.32,Default,,0,0,0,,who had taken me to his house when my parents both died.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.85,0:09:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,On his deathbed, he had made his wife, Aunt Reed, promise to look after me like her own children.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.33,0:09:12.31,Default,,0,0,0,,I supposed she now regretted her promise.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.35,0:09:15.51,Default,,0,0,0,,A strange idea came to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.75,0:09:21.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I felt sure that if Mr. Reed had lived, he would have treated me kindly.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.44,0:09:26.24,Default,,0,0,0,,And now, as I looked round at the dark furniture and the walls in shadow,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.38,0:09:32.33,Default,,0,0,0,,I began to fear that his ghost might come back to punish his wife for not keeping her promise.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.00,0:09:37.52,Default,,0,0,0,,He might rise from the grave in the churchyard and appear in this room.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.00,0:09:42.03,Default,,0,0,0,,I was so frightened by this thought that I hardly dared to breathe.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.06,0:09:48.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Suddenly, in the darkness, I saw a light moving on the ceiling.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.73,0:09:54.17,Default,,0,0,0,,It may have been from a lamp outside, but in my nervous state, I did not think of that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.69,0:09:59.33,Default,,0,0,0,,I felt sure it must be a ghost, a visitor from another world.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:59.85,0:10:03.37,Default,,0,0,0,,My head was hot. My heart beat fast.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.65,0:10:08.26,Default,,0,0,0,,Was that the sound of wings in my ears? Was that something moving near me?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.00,0:10:12.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Screaming wildly, I rushed to the door and shook it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:12.81,0:10:15.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Miss Abbott and Bessie came running to open it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.00,0:10:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Miss Eyre, are you ill? asked Bessie.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.00,0:10:22.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Take me out of here! I screamed.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.00,0:10:25.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Why? What's the matter? she asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.43,0:10:31.49,Default,,0,0,0,,I saw a light, and I thought it was a ghost, I cried, holding tightly onto Bessie's hand.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.00,0:10:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,She's not even hurt, said Miss Abbott in disgust.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.43,0:10:38.00,Default,,0,0,0,,She screamed just to bring us here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.00,0:10:40.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I know all our little tricks.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.49,0:10:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,What is all this? demanded an angry voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.00,0:10:46.66,Default,,0,0,0,,Mrs. Reed appeared at the door of the room.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:46.69,0:10:52.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Abbott and Bessie, I think I told you to leave Jane Eyre in this room till I came.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.72,0:10:56.45,Default,,0,0,0,,She screamed so loudly, Mum, said Bessie softly.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.00,0:11:01.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Let go of her hands, Bessie, was Mrs. Reed's only answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:01.73,0:11:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Jane Eyre, you need not think you can succeed in getting out of the room like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.00,0:11:10.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Your naughty tricks will not work with me.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.13,0:11:14.37,Default,,0,0,0,,You will stay here an hour longer as a punishment for trying to deceive us.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.00,0:11:19.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, Aunt, please forgive me. I can't bear it.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.00,0:11:21.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I shall die if you keep me here.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.45,0:11:24.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I screamed and kicked as she held me.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.78,0:11:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Silence! Control yourself!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:27.68,0:11:32.73,Default,,0,0,0,,She pushed me, resisting wildly, back into the red room and locked me in.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:33.00,0:11:37.21,Default,,0,0,0,,There I was in the darkness again with the silence and the ghosts.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.69,0:12:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I must have fainted. I cannot remember anything more.
