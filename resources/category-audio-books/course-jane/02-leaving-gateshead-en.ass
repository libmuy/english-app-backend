Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.00,0:00:09.75,Default,,0,0,0,,I woke up to find the doctor lifting me very carefully into my own bed.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.00,0:00:15.00,Default,,0,0,0,,It was good to be back in my familiar bedroom, with a warm fire and candlelight.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.00,0:00:21.72,Default,,0,0,0,,It was also a great relief to recognise Dr Lloyd, who Mrs Reed called in for her servants.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.64,0:00:25.00,Default,,0,0,0,,She always called a specialist for herself and the children.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.00,0:00:30.46,Default,,0,0,0,,He was looking after me so kindly, I felt he would protect me from Mrs Reed.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.44,0:00:35.28,Default,,0,0,0,,He talked to me a little, then gave Bessie orders to take good care of me.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.54,0:00:39.00,Default,,0,0,0,,When he left, I felt very lonely again.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.68,0:00:43.78,Default,,0,0,0,,But I was surprised to find that Bessie did not scold me at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.86,0:00:49.00,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, she was so kind to me that I became brave enough to ask a question.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.64,0:00:53.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Bessie, what's happened? Am I ill?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.46,0:01:01.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, you became ill in the bedroom, but you'll get better, don't worry Miss Jane, she answered.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.47,0:01:07.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Then she went next door to fetch another servant. I could hear her whispers.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.77,0:01:12.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Sarah, come in here and sleep with me and that poor child tonight.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.62,0:01:15.80,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't stay alone with her, she might die.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.86,0:01:20.57,Default,,0,0,0,,She was so ill last night. Do you think she saw a ghost?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.61,0:01:23.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Mrs Reed was too hard on her, I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.43,0:01:35.10,Default,,0,0,0,,So the two servants slept in my room while I lay awake all night, trembling with fear and eyes wide open in horror, imagining ghosts in every corner.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.18,0:01:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Fortunately, I suffered no serious illness as a result of my terrible experience in the red room, although I shall never forget that night.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.41,0:01:49.85,Default,,0,0,0,,But the shock left me nervous and depressed for the next few days.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.49,0:02:01.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I cried all day long, and although Bessie tried hard to tempt me with nice things to eat or my favourite books, I took no pleasure in eating or even in reading.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:01.30,0:02:05.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I knew I had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.30,0:02:11.62,Default,,0,0,0,,When the doctor came again, he seemed a little surprised to find me looking so miserable.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.00,0:02:18.30,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps she's crying because she couldn't go out with Mrs Reed in the carriage this morning, suggested Bessie.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.49,0:02:24.50,Default,,0,0,0,,Surely she's more sensible than that, said the doctor, smiling at me. She's a big girl now.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.92,0:02:32.62,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not crying about that. I hate going out in the carriage, I said quickly. I'm crying because I'm miserable.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.69,0:02:35.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, really, miss, said Bessie.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.00,0:02:41.61,Default,,0,0,0,,The doctor looked at me thoughtfully. He had small, grey, intelligent eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.65,0:02:44.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Just then a bell rang for the servants' dinner.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.70,0:02:50.01,Default,,0,0,0,,You can go, Bessie, he said. I'll stay here talking to Miss Jane till you come back.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.83,0:02:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,After Bessie had left, he asked,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.00,0:02:56.14,Default,,0,0,0,,What really made you ill?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.84,0:03:00.65,Default,,0,0,0,,I was locked up in a room with a ghost in the dark.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:00.94,0:03:04.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Afraid of ghosts, are you? he smiled.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.00,0:03:08.61,Default,,0,0,0,,Of Mr Reed's ghost, yes. He died in that room, you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.00,0:03:11.80,Default,,0,0,0,,Nobody even goes in there anymore. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.76,0:03:17.16,Default,,0,0,0,,It was cruel to lock me in there alone without a candle. I shall never forget it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:17.54,0:03:19.47,Default,,0,0,0,,But you aren't afraid now. 
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.45,0:03:24.42,Default,,0,0,0,,There must be another reason why you're so sad, he said, looking kindly at me.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.95,0:03:28.92,Default,,0,0,0,,How could I tell him all the reasons for my unhappiness?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.23,0:03:35.52,Default,,0,0,0,,I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters, I began.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.67,0:03:38.54,Default,,0,0,0,,But you have a kind aunt and cousins.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.78,0:03:44.71,Default,,0,0,0,,But John Reed knocked me down and my aunt locked me in the red room, I cried.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.00,0:03:46.54,Default,,0,0,0,,There was a pause.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.82,0:03:51.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't you like living at Gateshead in such a beautiful house? he asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.28,0:03:55.26,Default,,0,0,0,,I would be glad to leave it, but I have nowhere else to go.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:55.69,0:03:58.54,Default,,0,0,0,,You have no relations apart from Mrs Reed?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.86,0:04:05.17,Default,,0,0,0,,I think I may have some who are very poor, but I know nothing about them, I answered.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.61,0:04:09.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Would you like to go to school? he asked finally.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.00,0:04:11.00,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought for a moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.06,0:04:17.27,Default,,0,0,0,,I knew very little about school, but at least it would be a change, the start of a new life.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.25,0:04:22.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, I would like to go, I replied in the end.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.42,0:04:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, well, said the doctor to himself as he got up, we'll see.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.34,0:04:30.82,Default,,0,0,0,,A child is delicate, she ought to have a change of air.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.73,0:04:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,I heard later from the servants that he had spoken to Mrs Reed about me and that she had agreed immediately to send me to school.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.17,0:04:43.62,Default,,0,0,0,,Abbott said Mrs Reed would be glad to get rid of me.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.00,0:04:50.41,Default,,0,0,0,,In this conversation, I also learned for the first time that my father had been a poor vicar.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.55,0:04:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,,When he married my mother, Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead, the Reed family were so angry that they disinherited her.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.52,0:05:04.34,Default,,0,0,0,,I also heard that my parents both died of an illness only a year after their wedding.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.26,0:05:11.06,Default,,0,0,0,,But days and weeks passed, and Mrs Reed still said nothing about sending me to school.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.72,0:05:16.28,Default,,0,0,0,,One day, as she was scolding me, I suddenly threw a question at her.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.42,0:05:20.22,Default,,0,0,0,,The words just came out without my planning to say them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.51,0:05:26.34,Default,,0,0,0,,What would Uncle Reed say to you if he were alive, I asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.55,0:05:34.07,Default,,0,0,0,,What, cried Mrs Reed, her cold grey eyes full of fear, staring at me as if I were a ghost.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.11,0:05:35.90,Default,,0,0,0,,I had to continue.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.54,0:05:43.64,Default,,0,0,0,,My Uncle Reed is now in heaven and can see all you think and do, and so can my parents.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.53,0:05:46.73,Default,,0,0,0,,They know how you hate me and are cruel to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.12,0:05:51.38,Default,,0,0,0,,Mrs Reed smacked my face and left me without a word.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.53,0:05:56.83,Default,,0,0,0,,I was scolded for an hour by Bessie as the most ungrateful child in the world.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.79,0:06:01.58,Default,,0,0,0,,And indeed, with so much hate in my heart, I did feel wicked.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.47,0:06:07.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Christmas passed by, with no presents or new clothes for me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.14,0:06:13.27,Default,,0,0,0,,Every evening I watched Eliza and Georgiana putting on their new dresses and going out to parties.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.59,0:06:18.93,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes Bessie would come up to me in my lonely bedroom, bringing a piece of cake.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.91,0:06:24.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Sometimes she would tell me a story, and sometimes she would kiss me goodnight.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.67,0:06:32.73,Default,,0,0,0,,When she was kind to me, I thought she was the best person in the world, but she did not always have time for me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.74,0:06:40.82,Default,,0,0,0,,On the morning of the 15th of January, Bessie rushed up to my room to tell me a visitor wanted to see me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.00,0:06:47.44,Default,,0,0,0,,Who could it be? I knew Mrs Reed would be there too, and I was frightened of seeing her again.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.93,0:06:53.53,Default,,0,0,0,,When I nervously entered the breakfast room, I looked up at a black column.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.70,0:06:56.47,Default,,0,0,0,,At least that was what he looked like to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.31,0:07:04.51,Default,,0,0,0,,He was a tall, thin man dressed all in black, with a cold, stony face at the top of the column.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.20,0:07:10.34,Default,,0,0,0,,This is the little girl I wrote to you about, said Mrs Reed to the stony stranger.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:11.28,0:07:17.89,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, Jane Eyre, said the stranger heavily, and are you a good child?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.54,0:07:24.17,Default,,0,0,0,,It was impossible to say yes with Mrs Reed sitting there, so I was silent.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.00,0:07:30.73,Default,,0,0,0,,Perhaps the less said about that the better, Mr Brocklehurst, said Mrs Reed, shaking her head.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.14,0:07:34.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry to hear it, he answered.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.90,0:07:39.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Come here, Jane Eyre, and answer my questions.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.53,0:07:42.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Where do the wicked go after death?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.00,0:07:46.11,Default,,0,0,0,,They go to hell, I answered.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.33,0:07:50.89,Default,,0,0,0,,And what must you do to avoid going there? he asked.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.09,0:07:54.84,Default,,0,0,0,,I thought for a moment, but could not find the right answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.38,0:07:59.91,Default,,0,0,0,,I must keep in good health and not die, I replied.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.96,0:08:04.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Wrong! Children younger than you die all the time.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.00,0:08:09.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Another question. Do you enjoy reading the Bible?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.00,0:08:13.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, sometimes, I replied, hesitating.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.78,0:08:16.34,Default,,0,0,0,,That is not enough.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.68,0:08:20.15,Default,,0,0,0,,Your answers show me you have a wicked heart.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:19.90,0:08:24.11,Default,,0,0,0,,You must pray to God to change it if you ever want to go to heaven.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.90,0:08:28.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.12,0:08:33.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed, I mentioned to you in my letter that this little girl has in fact a very bad character.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.00,0:08:41.58,Default,,0,0,0,,If you accept her at Lowood School, please make sure that the headmistress and teachers know how dishonest she is.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.43,0:08:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,She will try to lie to them, of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.14,0:08:48.55,Default,,0,0,0,,You see, Jane, you cannot try your tricks on Mr Brocklehurst.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.50,0:08:55.46,Default,,0,0,0,,However hard I had tried to please Mrs Reed in the past, she always thought the worst of me.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.44,0:08:58.59,Default,,0,0,0,,It was not surprising that I had come to hate her.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.61,0:09:02.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Now she was accusing me in front of a stranger.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.12,0:09:06.32,Default,,0,0,0,,My hopes of starting a new life at school began to fade.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.40,0:09:10.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Do not worry, madam, Mr Brocklehurst said.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.74,0:09:13.33,Default,,0,0,0,,The teachers will watch her carefully.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.51,0:09:16.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Life at Lowood will do her good.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.37,0:09:23.52,Default,,0,0,0,,We believe in hard work, plain food, simple clothes and no luxury of any kind.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.86,0:09:27.56,Default,,0,0,0,,I will send her as soon as possible then, Mr Brocklehurst.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.48,0:09:31.40,Default,,0,0,0,,I hope she will be taught according to her low position in life.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:31.69,0:09:33.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Indeed she will, madam.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.70,0:09:38.40,Default,,0,0,0,,I hope she will be grateful for this opportunity to improve her character.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:38.47,0:09:41.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Little girl, read this book.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.94,0:09:45.29,Default,,0,0,0,,It tells the story of the sudden death of a young girl who was a liar.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.34,0:09:47.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Read and pray.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.65,0:09:54.12,Default,,0,0,0,,After Mr Brocklehurst had given me the book and left, I felt I had to speak.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.07,0:09:56.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Anger was boiling up inside me.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.89,0:10:00.84,Default,,0,0,0,,I walked up to Mrs Reed and looked straight into her eyes.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.06,0:10:04.16,Default,,0,0,0,,I do not deceive people.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.12,0:10:10.44,Default,,0,0,0,,If I told lies, I would say I loved you. But I don't. I hate you.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:10.28,0:10:14.15,Default,,0,0,0,,I will never call you aunt again as long as I live.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:14.09,0:10:21.00,Default,,0,0,0,,If anyone asks how you treated me, I will tell them the truth, that you are very cruel to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.00,0:10:25.15,Default,,0,0,0,,People think you're a good woman, but you are lying to them.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.83,0:10:31.76,Default,,0,0,0,,Even before I'd finished, I began to experience a great feeling of freedom and relief.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:31.74,0:10:35.10,Default,,0,0,0,,At last I had said what I felt.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.27,0:10:38.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Mrs Reed looked frightened and unhappy.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:38.37,0:10:47.00,Default,,0,0,0,,Jane, I want to be your friend. You don't know what you're saying. You are too excited. Go to your room and lie down.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:47.00,0:10:54.76,Default,,0,0,0,,I won't lie down. I'm quite calm. Send me to school soon, Mrs Reed. I hate living here.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.33,0:11:00.44,Default,,0,0,0,,I will indeed send her soon, murmured Mrs Reed to herself.
