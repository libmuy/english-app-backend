Chapter 2 Leaving Gateshead

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,753
I woke up to find the doctor lifting me very carefully into my own bed.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was good to be back in my familiar bedroom, with a warm fire and candlelight.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,643
It was also a great relief to recognise Dr Lloyd, who Mrs Reed called in for her servants.

5
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:21,716
She always called a specialist for herself and the children.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,436
He was looking after me so kindly, I felt he would protect me from Mrs Reed.

8
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:30,461
He talked to me a little, then gave Bessie orders to take good care of me.

9
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:35,280
He talked to me a little, then gave Bessie orders to take good care of me.

10
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:39,000
When he left, I felt very lonely again.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,778
But I was surprised to find that Bessie did not scold me at all.

12
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:49,000
In fact, she was so kind to me that I became brave enough to ask a question.

13
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:53,600
Bessie, what's happened? Am I ill?

14
00:00:54,455 --> 00:01:01,932
Yes, you became ill in the bedroom, but you'll get better, don't worry Miss Jane, she answered.

15
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:07,716
Then she went next door to fetch another servant. I could hear her whispers.

16
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:12,615
Sarah, come in here and sleep with me and that poor child tonight.

17
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:12,750
I don't stay alone with her, she might die.
Sarah, come in here and sleep with me and that poor child tonight.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,796
I don't stay alone with her, she might die.

19
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:20,566
She was so ill last night. Do you think she saw a ghost?

20
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:23,729
Mrs Reed was too hard on her, I think.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:35,095
So the two servants slept in my room while I lay awake all night, trembling with fear and eyes wide open in horror, imagining ghosts in every corner.

22
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:45,000
Fortunately, I suffered no serious illness as a result of my terrible experience in the red room, although I shall never forget that night.

23
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,852
But the shock left me nervous and depressed for the next few days.

24
00:01:50,486 --> 00:02:01,298
I cried all day long, and although Bessie tried hard to tempt me with nice things to eat or my favourite books, I took no pleasure in eating or even in reading.

25
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:01,347
I knew I had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to.

26
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:05,618
I knew I had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,618
When the doctor came again, he seemed a little surprised to find me looking so miserable.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,301
Perhaps she's crying because she couldn't go out with Mrs Reed in the carriage this morning, suggested Bessie.

29
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:24,504
Surely she's more sensible than that, said the doctor, smiling at me. She's a big girl now.

30
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:32,615
I'm not crying about that. I hate going out in the carriage, I said quickly. I'm crying because I'm miserable.

31
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:35,796
Oh, really, miss, said Bessie.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,612
The doctor looked at me thoughtfully. He had small, grey, intelligent eyes.

33
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,609
Just then a bell rang for the servants' dinner.

34
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:50,012
You can go, Bessie, he said. I'll stay here talking to Miss Jane till you come back.

35
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,000
After Bessie had left, he asked,

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,141
What really made you ill?

37
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,646
I was locked up in a room with a ghost in the dark.

38
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,000
Afraid of ghosts, are you? he smiled.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,609
Of Mr Reed's ghost, yes. He died in that room, you know.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,760
Nobody even goes in there anymore. 

41
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:11,803
It was cruel to lock me in there alone without a candle. I shall never forget it.
Nobody even goes in there anymore. 

42
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:17,163
It was cruel to lock me in there alone without a candle. I shall never forget it.

43
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,446
But you aren't afraid now. 

44
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:19,470
There must be another reason why you're so sad, he said, looking kindly at me.
But you aren't afraid now. 

45
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,420
There must be another reason why you're so sad, he said, looking kindly at me.

46
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:28,923
How could I tell him all the reasons for my unhappiness?

47
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:35,520
I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters, I began.

48
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,541
But you have a kind aunt and cousins.

49
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:44,707
But John Reed knocked me down and my aunt locked me in the red room, I cried.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,535
There was a pause.

51
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:51,095
Don't you like living at Gateshead in such a beautiful house? he asked.

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,261
I would be glad to leave it, but I have nowhere else to go.

53
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,535
You have no relations apart from Mrs Reed?

54
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:05,169
I think I may have some who are very poor, but I know nothing about them, I answered.

55
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:09,000
Would you like to go to school? he asked finally.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,996
I thought for a moment.

57
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:17,267
I knew very little about school, but at least it would be a change, the start of a new life.

58
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, I would like to go, I replied in the end.

59
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, well, said the doctor to himself as he got up, we'll see.

60
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:30,818
A child is delicate, she ought to have a change of air.

61
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:39,723
I heard later from the servants that he had spoken to Mrs Reed about me and that she had agreed immediately to send me to school.

62
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,624
Abbott said Mrs Reed would be glad to get rid of me.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,406
In this conversation, I also learned for the first time that my father had been a poor vicar.

64
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:58,320
When he married my mother, Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead, the Reed family were so angry that they disinherited her.

65
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:04,344
I also heard that my parents both died of an illness only a year after their wedding.

66
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:11,064
But days and weeks passed, and Mrs Reed still said nothing about sending me to school.

67
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:16,276
One day, as she was scolding me, I suddenly threw a question at her.

68
00:05:16,424 --> 00:05:20,215
The words just came out without my planning to say them.

69
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:26,338
What would Uncle Reed say to you if he were alive, I asked.

70
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:34,067
What, cried Mrs Reed, her cold grey eyes full of fear, staring at me as if I were a ghost.

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,895
I had to continue.

72
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:43,532
My Uncle Reed is now in heaven and can see all you think and do, and so can my parents.

73
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:43,643
They know how you hate me and are cruel to me.
My Uncle Reed is now in heaven and can see all you think and do, and so can my parents.

74
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,726
They know how you hate me and are cruel to me.

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,378
Mrs Reed smacked my face and left me without a word.

76
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:56,793
I was scolded for an hour by Bessie as the most ungrateful child in the world.

77
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:56,830
And indeed, with so much hate in my heart, I did feel wicked.
I was scolded for an hour by Bessie as the most ungrateful child in the world.

78
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,581
And indeed, with so much hate in my heart, I did feel wicked.

79
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:07,000
Christmas passed by, with no presents or new clothes for me.

80
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:13,267
Every evening I watched Eliza and Georgiana putting on their new dresses and going out to parties.

81
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:18,910
Sometimes Bessie would come up to me in my lonely bedroom, bringing a piece of cake.

82
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:18,929
Sometimes she would tell me a story, and sometimes she would kiss me goodnight.
Sometimes Bessie would come up to me in my lonely bedroom, bringing a piece of cake.

83
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:24,400
Sometimes she would tell me a story, and sometimes she would kiss me goodnight.

84
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:32,726
When she was kind to me, I thought she was the best person in the world, but she did not always have time for me.

85
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:40,824
On the morning of the 15th of January, Bessie rushed up to my room to tell me a visitor wanted to see me.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,440
Who could it be? I knew Mrs Reed would be there too, and I was frightened of seeing her again.

87
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:53,526
When I nervously entered the breakfast room, I looked up at a black column.

88
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,467
At least that was what he looked like to me.

89
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:04,510
He was a tall, thin man dressed all in black, with a cold, stony face at the top of the column.

90
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,338
This is the little girl I wrote to you about, said Mrs Reed to the stony stranger.

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,889
Well, Jane Eyre, said the stranger heavily, and are you a good child?

92
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:24,166
It was impossible to say yes with Mrs Reed sitting there, so I was silent.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,726
Perhaps the less said about that the better, Mr Brocklehurst, said Mrs Reed, shaking her head.

94
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,560
I'm sorry to hear it, he answered.

95
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:39,064
Come here, Jane Eyre, and answer my questions.

96
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:42,356
Where do the wicked go after death?

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,110
They go to hell, I answered.

98
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:50,886
And what must you do to avoid going there? he asked.

99
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,836
I thought for a moment, but could not find the right answer.

100
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:59,913
I must keep in good health and not die, I replied.

101
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:04,806
Wrong! Children younger than you die all the time.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,064
Another question. Do you enjoy reading the Bible?

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,741
Yes, sometimes, I replied, hesitating.

104
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,344
That is not enough.

105
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:19,901
Your answers show me you have a wicked heart.

106
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:20,153
You must pray to God to change it if you ever want to go to heaven.
Your answers show me you have a wicked heart.

107
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:24,110
You must pray to God to change it if you ever want to go to heaven.

108
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,116
Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed,

109
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:28,178
Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed, I mentioned to you in my letter that this little girl has in fact a very bad character.
Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed,

110
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:33,809
Mr Brocklehurst, interrupted Mrs Reed, I mentioned to you in my letter that this little girl has in fact a very bad character.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,433
If you accept her at Lowood School, please make sure that the headmistress and teachers know how dishonest she is.

112
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:41,581
She will try to lie to them, of course.
If you accept her at Lowood School, please make sure that the headmistress and teachers know how dishonest she is.

She will try to lie to them, of course.

114
00:08:44,135 --> 00:08:48,547
You see, Jane, you cannot try your tricks on Mr Brocklehurst.

115
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:55,440
However hard I had tried to please Mrs Reed in the past, she always thought the worst of me.

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,458
It was not surprising that I had come to hate her.

It was not surprising that I had come to hate her.

118
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:02,116
Now she was accusing me in front of a stranger.

119
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:02,172
My hopes of starting a new life at school began to fade.

121
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,744
Do not worry, madam, Mr Brocklehurst said.

00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:10,867
The teachers will watch her carefully.
Do not worry, madam, Mr Brocklehurst said.

124
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:16,369
Life at Lowood will do her good.

We believe in hard work, plain food, simple clothes and no luxury of any kind.

127
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:27,476
I will send her as soon as possible then, Mr Brocklehurst.

128
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:27,556
I hope she will be taught according to her low position in life.
I will send her as soon as possible then, Mr Brocklehurst.

I hope she will be taught according to her low position in life.

130
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:33,704
Indeed she will, madam.

131
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:33,760
I hope she will be grateful for this opportunity to improve her character.
Indeed she will, madam.

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,400
I hope she will be grateful for this opportunity to improve her character.

133
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,935
Little girl, read this book.

134
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:41,000
It tells the story of the sudden death of a young girl who was a liar.

Read and pray.

137
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:54,067
After Mr Brocklehurst had given me the book and left, I felt I had to speak.

138
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:54,123
Anger was boiling up inside me.
After Mr Brocklehurst had given me the book and left, I felt I had to speak.

Anger was boiling up inside me.

140
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:00,843
I walked up to Mrs Reed and looked straight into her eyes.

141
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:04,116
I do not deceive people.

142
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:04,160
If I told lies, I would say I loved you. But I don't. I hate you.

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,150
People think you're a good woman, but you are lying to them.

149
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:31,735
Even before I'd finished, I began to experience a great feeling of freedom and relief.

150
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:31,760
At last I had said what I felt.
Even before I'd finished, I began to experience a great feeling of freedom and relief.

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,095
At last I had said what I felt.

152
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,000
Mrs Reed looked frightened and unhappy.

153
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:47,000
Jane, I want to be your friend. You don't know what you're saying. You are too excited. Go to your room and lie down.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,763
I won't lie down. I'm quite calm. Send me to school soon, Mrs Reed. I hate living here.

155
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:00,443
I will indeed send her soon, murmured Mrs Reed to herself.
